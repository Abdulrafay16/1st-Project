            <b> Muhammad Ali Jinnah </b>(Urdu pronunciation: [mʊɦəm.məd̪ əliː
            d͡ʒɪnːɑːɦ], Gujarati pronunciation: [məɦ(ə)məd̪ əli d͡ʒʱiɽ̃ɑ]; born
            Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a
            barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan.[1] Jinnah served
            as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the
            inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of
            Pakistan's first governor-general until his death. He is revered in
            Pakistan as the Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum
            ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a national
            holiday in Pakistan.

              British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an
              interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal
              practice.
